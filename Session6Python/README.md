# Programming with Python Workshop
This workshop introduces students to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language through Turtle Graphics.

The student material is available online at [bit.ly/python-camp](https://bit.ly/python-camp/).

## Possible Durations
The material in this workshop is adaptable to several different timing options.

### 45 Minutes
For a 45 minute workshop, start with the follow-along and skip all of the optional sections. With any remaining time after the follow-along activity, students can work on the challenges.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (no optional sections) | 35m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 10m |

### 60 Minutes
For an hour long workshop, start with the follow-along. If the group is moving a little quicker, it may be beneficial to go over some of the optional sections. Either way, the students should have around 15 minutes to work on the challenges at the end.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (selected optional sections) | 45m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 15m |

### 1.5 Hours
For an hour-and-a-half workshop, start with an icebreaker. After that, move on to the follow-along. With this timeframe, it will be beneficial to go over all of the optional sections. Next, play the Kahoot that covers the material from the follow-along. After the follow-along, students can work on the challenges.

Sometimes, students will get bored with a long challenge portion. For this reason, it is recommended to limit the challenge time to 20 minutes.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 10m |
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (with optional sections) | 50m |
| [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-programming-with-python-quiz/94268b8a-33b6-49ad-b739-ef325c55c540) | 10m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 20m |

### 2.5 Hours
For a two-and-a-half-hour workshop, start with an icebreaker. After that, present the lecture PowerPoint, and play the Kahoot. It is recommended to take a break after the Kahoot, and then begin the follow-along activity. During the follow-along, complete all of the optional sections. After the follow-along, students can work on the challenges.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 10m |
| [Lecture](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) | 20m |
| [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/programming-with-python-quiz/e467016f-1971-4e14-b247-7e5e0f87c00c) | 10m |
| Break | 10m |
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (with optional sections) | 50m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 50m |

## Virtual Camp: 1.5 Hours
In the event of a global pandemic, it may be necessary to facilitate this workshop virtually.

1. Start with a short interactive icebreaker.
1. Then, move onto the lecture. Use the [Virtual Version](ProgrammingWithPythonVirtual.pptx) of the presentation. Make sure to keep it interactive - ask the students questions, and try to keep everyone involved as much as possible. The lecture does not include material about conditional statements.
1. After the lecture, do the [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-programming-with-python-quiz/d3389274-eb94-4f64-8716-b48b307d6cd8). Note that this Kahoot is different than the normal Kahoot; it does not include material about conditional statements.
1. An actual follow-along activity will be difficult. The students may only have a small laptop/chromebook screen, so it may be a challenge for them to watch the instructor and also write their own code at the same time. It should be possible to go through the [follow-along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) with the students, but it may not go smoothly.
1. After the follow-along, the students can move on to the challenges.

### Suggested Schedule

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 10m |
| Lecture | 20m |
| Kahoot | 10m |
| Follow-Along | 40m |
| Challenges | 10m |

## Icebreaker
The icebreaker activity is built into the [ProgrammingWithPython.pptx](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation. Students will think of questions, and other students will have to answer them.

Optionally, instead of the PowerPoint icebreaker, choose a different icebreaker for the group. Or, depending on the situation, do not do an icebreaker activity.

### Virtual Icebreaker
Doing an icebreaker virtually can be difficult, but it is not impossible. The purpose of the icebreaker is to welcome students into the "classroom" and make them feel comfortable. They can also get to know each other through the activity. It should be interactive, and every student should have a chance to participate. Here are some ideas for virtual icebreakers:

- Have each student submit a question in the Zoom chat. Enter the questions in [this Python trinket](https://trinket.io/python/372d404f0f?outputOnly=true&runOption=run) to play a game where each student gets a random question from the list of questions.
    - For the trinket, make sure to expand the window and zoom in appropriately so everyone can see the text.
- Create a Zoom whiteboard and allow students to draw on it for a while.
- Use [jigsawpuzzles.io](https://jigsawpuzzles.io/) to create a virtual puzzle, and let the students complete it as a group.
- Use [gartic.io](https://gartic.io/) to play virtual pictionary as a group.

## Lecture
The lecture introduces Python using the [Programming With Python](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation. Students will follow along with the lecture using [trinket](https://trinket.io). The lecture covers:
- Python uses
- Trinket
- Printing messages
- Variables
- User input
- Conditionals
- For loops

It should be interactive, and the students should be engaged. The lecture is optional; if the duration is shorter, skip the lecture and start with the code-along.

## Kahoot
There is are two versions of the Kahoot for the workshop.

### Lecture Kahoot
If the PowerPoint was presented, use [this Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/programming-with-python-quiz/e467016f-1971-4e14-b247-7e5e0f87c00c) quiz that covers the content from the lecture. There is a link to the quiz from the [Programming With Python](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation.

### Follow-Along Kahoot
If no PowerPoint was presented, use [this Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-programming-with-python-quiz/94268b8a-33b6-49ad-b739-ef325c55c540) **AFTER** the follow-along activity. This version covers the content from the follow-along.

## Turtle Follow-Along
An instructor should walk through the instructions in the [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) file. Students should follow along and type what the instructor types. The instructor should ask questions of the students along the way, and make sure they are engaged and interacting.

### Follow-Along Challenges
The follow-along activity includes built-in challenges the students can attempt. For those sections, the instructor should give the students some time to complete the task, and then go over how to do it. In the interest of time, not every student is required to finish each challenge.

## Turtle Challenges
After the follow-along activity, students can attempt the challenges at https://bit.ly/PyChallenges. If they finish those challenges, or become bored, there are additional turtle examples. Students can copy and paste examples and update them as they wish.

At some point during the challenge period, an instructor can show and explain some of the more advanced examples to the whole class. This should hopefully inspire the students to continue playing around with their own turtles.
