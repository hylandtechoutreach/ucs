# About Me: Individual
Continue the development of your "About Me" webpage.

## Favorite Food
Add some more elements to your webpage that will describe your favorite foods. You will need to provide information about at least two foods you enjoy. Under the "Favorite Animal" `img` element, add another `h3` header that says "Favorite Foods". Then, repeat the instructions below for two (or more) of your favorite foods.

1. Add a smaller `h4` header with the name of your favorite food
    - Within the header, indicate the rank of this food (e.g., "1. Rice")
1. Add an image of your favorite food in an `img` image tag
    - Remember to set the `src` value to an _image address_
1. Add a brief description of your favorite food within a `p` paragraph

## Other Favorites
In addition to listing some favorite foods, think of some of your other favorite things. Movies, songs, video games, athletes, or really anything else! Add more images and text to your webpage describing these other favorites.
