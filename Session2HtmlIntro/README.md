# Basic HTML Elements
For the first content lesson of the series, go over HTML elements. The purpose of this lesson is to show the students what they can create with some basic elements. Overall, this first lesson should be pretty straightforward. Introduce HTML, show the students some examples and have them get some hands-on experience writing HTML.

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint Presentation](HelloHtml.pptx) introduces the idea of HTML and shows how some basic elements work.

## Typing Practice
Give students some time to practice typing, specifically HTML. The goal is for them to get used to typing HTML symbols (like `<`, `>`, `/`, `=`, and tag names) without having to worry about what any of it means.

## Kahoot
There is a [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/740e9179-5b3b-426c-a5ef-e770b2bd60c4) covering the content from the lecture.

## Code-Along Activity: About Me Website
Walk through the [About Me Code-Along](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should build a simple website about themselves.

## Individual Exercise: About Me Website Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](AboutMeIndividual.md) independently to continue building their "About Me" website. They can theoretically add any appropriate content using the HTML elements covered by the lesson.

## Sharing Sites
Students should have an opportunity to share their sites with the group at the end.
