# Basic HTML Elements
For the first content lesson of the series, go over HTML elements. The purpose of this lesson is to show the students what they can create with some basic elements. Overall, this first lesson should be pretty straightforward. Introduce HTML, show the students some examples and have them get some hands-on experience writing HTML.

## Warm Up
Start with a fun icebreaker/game.

### Candy Questions
Students either choose a type of candy or spin a wheel to determine which question they have to answer. 

- What would you do if you had a million dollars?
- What is your dream vacation destination?
- What is your dream job?
- What is your favorite food?

## Code-Along Activity: About Me Website
Walk through the [About Me Code-Along](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should build a simple website about themselves.

## Individual Exercise: About Me Website Updates
