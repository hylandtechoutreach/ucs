# Introduction to CSS
For this session, introduce students to CSS. They can use CSS to make their websites look a lot more fun and interesting. 

## Warm Up
Start with a [color scheme creation exercise](CoolorsWarmUp.md).

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint Presentation](HelloCss.pptx) introduces the idea of CSS, separate files, links, and some basic syntax - selectors and properties.

## Code-Along Activity: Bananas
Walk through the [Bananas Code-Along](BananasCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should take an existing HTML website, and add some CSS to it.

## Individual Exercise: Bananas Website Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](BananasIndividual.md) independently to make more updates to the Banana site. They can theoretically make any CSS changes they would like, and they can also go back and apply CSS to their previous work.

## Tangential Activity - Name All Colors Sporcle
If there is enough time, close out the session with an activity where the students work as a group to try and name all colors available on the web. Go to the [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/games/rockgolf/rainbow-coalition), click the "PLAY QUIZ" button, and have students shout out as many answers as they can. It does not need to take the full 15 minutes on the timer - 10 minutes should be long enough.
