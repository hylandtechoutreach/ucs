# More HTML: Sub Plan
For this session, students can continue to work on the websites they started building in the previous weeks. Students expressed interest in working on their sites, so hopefully they will have fun adding things and changing things.

There is one activity that requires an instructor computer to project something (the Baamboozle quiz) - hopefully this will be possible, but if not, the students should be okay just working on their chromebooks the whole time.

### Student Content
Students should know where to find the content for this week: [https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs/MoreHtmlSub/StudentDesc.html](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs/MoreHtmlSub/StudentDesc.html)

They should all have the [main academy page](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs/) bookmarked by now, and then just have to click the link for today's date. If they need to get to the main academy page, they can find it at **bit.ly/ucshyland**.

## Outline
The bulk of this lesson should be students working independently, but there are a couple other things as well.

### Lesson Introduction
Go over the [student content](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs/MoreHtmlSub/StudentDesc.html) for the lesson. Make sure the students know they are welcome to work on their previous websites, and add whatever they would like. They are also welcome to create brand new websites using the starter code. Be warned, the starter code is a little weird... it is highly inspired by current and former student interests. Whether they are working on old projects or creating new ones, they will need to log into [VS Code for Education](https://vscodeedu.com/) (they can log in with Google).

You can also show them the [ideas page](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs/MoreHtmlSub/Ideas.html) - this will help them think of things they could add to their sites.

If they need a bit more structure, they can try playing [this code game](https://www.w3schools.com/codegame/) linked from the lesson homepage. It is not directly related to website building, but it can help them practice computational thinking.

### Self-Paced Work
Hopefully, students will be able to work independently and will be motivated to keep improving their websites with new ideas. However, if they are struggling to think of things they'd like to add, have them choose something from the Ideas page. There are a lot of examples of things they can do. I have found that presenting one of the ideas as a "challenge" can help motivate them to actually read the instructions and do it - but sometimes it requires a bribe of "whoever finishes this first gets a piece of candy next week" or something.

If they have something they want to add, but can't figure out how to add it, I always recommend searching Google for "html css how to ....." and put in what they are trying to do. Often, a result will pop up that has some example code. They can try copying that code into their project, but they may need to make some updates to it to get it to work the way they want.

If they are getting an error, one thing they can do is to copy the error into Google and see if there are any results that show them how to fix it. Otherwise, some issues can be sort of difficult to fix without prior experience - although sometimes students can help each other figure things out.

### Baamboozle Quiz
With approximately ~10 minutes remaining, facilitate the Baamboozle quiz. If possible, log into Baamboozle in order to select the grid size - that way, it will be possible for the students to see all the questions from the question set.

1. Split the room into two teams (Team 1 and Team 2)
1. [Click here to open the quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/2574964)
1. Click the "Play" button on the left
1. Select the free version
1. If able, set the grid size to 24
1. Select the Classic mode
1. Let Team 1 pick a number on the board
1. When the question is revealed, give them some time to answer (~20 seconds or so)
1. When they've locked in their answer, click the "Check" button
1. Click "Okay!" if they got it right, or "Oops!" if they got it wrong
1. Repeat with Team 2
1. Continue until the game has ended

If there is time for another round, it may make sense to play the game again.
