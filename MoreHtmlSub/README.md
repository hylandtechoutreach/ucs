# More HTML: Sub Plan
For this session, students can continue to work on the websites they started building in the previous weeks. Students expressed interest in working on their sites, so hopefully they will have fun adding things and changing things.

There is one activity that requires an instructor computer to project something (the Baamboozle quiz) - hopefully this will be possible, but if not, the students should be okay just working on their chromebooks the whole time.

### Student Content
Students should know where to find the content for this week: 


### Baamboozle Quiz
With approximately ~10 minutes remaining, facilitate the Baamboozle quiz. If possible, log into Baamboozle in order to select the grid size - that way, it will be possible for the students to see all the questions from the question set.

1. Split the room into two teams (Team 1 and Team 2)
1. [Click here to open the quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/2574964)
1. Click the "Play" button on the left
1. Select the free version
1. If able, set the grid size to 24
1. Select the Classic mode
1. Let Team 1 pick a number on the board
1. When the question is revealed, give them some time to answer (~20 seconds or so)
1. When they've locked in their answer, click the "Check" button
1. Click "Okay!" if they got it right, or "Oops!" if they got it wrong
1. Repeat with Team 2
1. Continue until the game has ended

If there is time for another round, it may make sense to play the game again.
