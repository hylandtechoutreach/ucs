# More HTML Elements
For the second content lesson of the series, go over some additional HTML elements, as well as using multiple HTML pages. The purpose of this lesson is to allow the students to do more with HTML.

## Warm-up Kahoot
Start by facilitating the [same Kahoot quiz from the previous session](https://create.kahoot.it/details/740e9179-5b3b-426c-a5ef-e770b2bd60c4). Hopefully the students will remember some of what they learned; either way, this will be a good chance to review.

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint Presentation](MoreHtmlElements.pptx) introduces the new elements and the concept of multiple HTML files.

## Code-Along Activity: Restaurant Website
Walk through the [Restaurant Website Code-Along](RestaurantWebsiteCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should build a multi-page website for a restaurant. The website can be adapted for many different types of food, like pizza, tacos, sushi, sandwiches, etc.

## Individual Exercise: Restaurant Website Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](RestaurantIndividual.md) independently to continue building their restaurant websites. Possibly have students work together on the individual work. There will be some guidance, but they can ultimately decide how they would like to update their restaurant websites.

## Sharing Sites
Students should have an opportunity to share their sites with the group toward the end.

## Baamboozle Quiz
To close out the session, play through a [Baamboozle group quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/506338) that covers the material from the lesson.
