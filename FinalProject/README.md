# Final Project
The main goal of the final project is for the students to have fun building something more long-term. They should have one session to work on whatever they would like, and one session to [present](Presentations.md). Ultimately it will be up to them what they want to build. Some of them may have already started websites that they want to continue building - this is okay, as long as they have enough new features to add.

Instructors should encourage students to keep adding more to their sites. If they say they are "done," tell them to try adding another page, or more text content, or another image, or more styles. There is always more to add.
