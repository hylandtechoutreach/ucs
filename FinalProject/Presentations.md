# Final Project Presentations
We will ask you to share your website with the class when you're done! All you have to do is show your site, and talk about what you built.

If you're apprehensive about getting up in front of everybody, don't worry! Presentations can be under a minute, and you can even stay in your seat when it's your turn. We just want to give everybody a chance to show off what they made. We know you'll do great!
