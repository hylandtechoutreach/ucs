# More CSS - Classes
For this session, introduce CSS classes to the students. They can use classes to style HTML elements more specifically.

## Icebreaker
For this week, present a [Mad Libs Icebreaker](../Icebreakers/MadLibsIcebreaker.md).

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint Presentation](CssClassSelector.pptx) introduces CSS classes.

## Kahoot
Facilitate the [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/3b80ee62-4b67-49d6-b89d-1edd80a4db23) to gauge student understanding from the lecture.

## Code-Along Activity: Rainbow Poem
Walk through the [Rainbow Poem Code-Along](RainbowPoemCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should take an existing HTML website that uses some CSS classes, and update it to do more.

## Individual Exercise: Rainbow Poem Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](RainbowPoemIndividual.md) independently to make more updates to the Poem site. They should have a chance to make the site their own.

## Group Review Activity
If there is extra time at the end and the students are having trouble focusing, walk through the [CSS Review Activity PowerPoint Presentation](CssReview.pptx) for more structured practice. Play [Around the World](https://www.greatgroupgames.com/around-the-world), or simply ask the questions to students one by one. Note that this exercise will only be necessary if the students are not focusing on their websites - otherwise, they should be able to continue working on their sites.
