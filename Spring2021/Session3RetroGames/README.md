## Lecture
The [lecture](RetroGames.pptx) provides some background information about retro games. The goal is to relate to the experience of the students as much as possible, and prepare them for the code-along activity. Check the Kahoot quiz questions to see which points might be worth emphasizing.

## Kahoot
The [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-retro-games/12625252-42b6-4b7f-94d4-d0b61ac21f6c) covers the content from the lecture.

## Code-Along
Walk through the [Code-Along](CodeAlong.md) with the students. Start building a simple platformer using MakeCode Arcade.

Make sure to keep the "jumpy platformer" introduction time-bound. After a certain amount of time (2-3 minutes), tell the students it is time to stop. After that, share the code-along instructions in the Zoom chat and begin walking through it.

### Deviations
The students should be able to:

- Name their "Main Character" sprite something different
- Draw their own character, tile, and map
- Change the values for the controller `vx`, the gravity `ay`, the jump `vy`, the animation `interval`, and the `game over` effects

Other than those things, they should follow the instructor's code.

## Challenges
The goal of the [challenges](Challenges.md) is to inspire the students to continue playing with MakeCode Arcade. They provide some direction for the students to add features to their game. It is not necessary for the students to follow the challenge guidelines directly, as long as they continue to work on game development.

## Game Sharing
Toward the end of the session, students should have an opportunity to share what they have created. They can follow the steps on the [Sharing Games page](SharingGames.md).
