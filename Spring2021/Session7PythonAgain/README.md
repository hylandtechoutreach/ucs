# ASCII Art with Python
This workshop introduces [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) and Python console applications.

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint Presentation](PythonConsole.pptx) covers the console, changing colors, ASCII art, and Python functions.

## Baamboozle Team Quiz
Split the group into two teams, and have them play the [review quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/428927). This quiz covers the content from the lecture.

## ASCII Art Code-Along
Walk through the [code-along](AsciiArtCodeAlong.md) with the students - it shows how to create functions to draw a couple of animals to the console with different colors.

## Challenges
With any time remaining, students can work on the [challenges](AsciiArtChallenges.md). They can also [share their work](../Session6Python/SharingWork.md).
