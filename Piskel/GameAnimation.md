# Game Animation
Artists often create pixel art animations to be used in retro-style games. Follow the instructions to modify an existing game with new custom art! Google Chrome is recommended for this activity.

## The Existing Game
For the purposes of this exercise, there is an existing game within a project to use. Start by creating a copy of the game, and playing it.

1. Go to the [Existing Game Project](https://vscodeedu.com/vSnMpC4iN9JHbSZ3Gx8w)
2. Click the "Run" button to run the game
3. Expand the Preview area so there is room to play the game

Play through the game to see how it works!

## Modifying the Player Walk Cycle
Next, create your own version of the player walk cycle. At this point, try not to change too much - it will always be possible to come back and further customize the player.

### Importing the Existing Player
Follow the steps below to import the player sprite.

<img src="player.png" style="border: 1px solid black" width="300px">

1. Right click the picture above and select "Save image as..."
1. Save the image on your computer with **player.png** as the name
1. Open a new web browser tab, and go to [www.piskelapp.com](https://www.piskelapp.com)
1. Click the "Create Sprite" button  
    ![](Assets/CreateSprite.png)
1. In the sprite editor, on the right, click the "IMPORT" folder icon  
    ![](Assets/Import.png)
1. In the menu that appears, click the "Browse images" button  
    ![](Assets/BrowseImages.png)
1. Find the saved **player.png** file and select it for opening
1. Select the "Import as spritesheet" option  
    ![](Assets/ImportPlayerAsSpritesheet.png)
1. Set the Frame size to 32 x 32
1. Click the "import" button  
    ![](Assets/ImportButtonPlayer.png)
1. If a pop-up appears asking if you want to continue, click the "OK" button

Now the four frames of the player sprite should be ready for editing!

### Modifying the Player
Now, the next step is to update the player sprite a little bit.

1. Make a small change to the player, like the color of their head
   - Do not change the number of frames
   - Do not change the size of the canvas
   - Do not change the basic "Walk Cycle" frames
   - Make sure to change each frame of the animation 
1. Click the "Export" button on the right side of the window  
   ![](Assets/Export.png)
1. Make sure "Scale" is set to **1.0x**
1. In the EXPORT menu, select the "PNG" tab  
   ![](Assets/ExportPngTab.png)
1. Change the "Spritesheet layout options" so there are **4 columns**  
   ![](Assets/ExportFourColumnLayout.png)
1. In the "Spritesheet file export" part, click the "Download" button  
   ![](Assets/ExportDownloadButton.png)
1. Save the file somewhere with the name **player.png**

Now the updated player should be ready to enter the existing game!

## Putting the New Player in the Game
It's time to update the game itself with the new player. You will have to drag your saved file into the **Assets** area and make sure it has the proper name to match the old name!

Run the program again, and at this point, the new player should appear!

## Next Steps
After the follow-along activity, there are some [challenges](AnimationChallenges.md) to complete. Or, you can feel free to get creative and do whatever you want to do with Piskel!
