# Game Animation
Artists often create pixel art animations to be used in retro-style games. Follow the instructions to modify an existing game with new custom art! Google Chrome is recommended for this activity.

## The Existing Game
For the purposes of this exercise, there is an existing game within a Repl project to use. Start by creating a fork of the game, and playing it.

1. Go to the [Existing Game Repl Project](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer)
1. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right
1. Click the "Run" button to run the game
1. Expand the Preview area so there is room to play the game

Play through the game to see how it works!

## Modifying the Player Walk Cycle
Next, create your own version of the player walk cycle. At this point, try not to change too much - it will always be possible to come back and further customize the player.

1. Open a new web browser tab
1. Go to the existing [Player Walking Piskel Animation](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/agxzfnBpc2tlbC1hcHByEwsSBlBpc2tlbBiAgOD48dSaCgw/edit)
1. Make a small change to the player, like the color of their head
   - Do not change the number of frames
   - Do not change the size of the canvas
   - Do not change the basic "Walk Cycle" frames
1. Click the "Export" button on the right side of the window

1. In the EXPORT menu, select the "PNG" tab

1. Change the "Spritesheet layout options" so there are **4 columns**

1. In the "Spritesheet file export" part, click the "Download" button  
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/1KhYoV5.png)
1. Save the file somewhere with the name **player.png**

Now the updated player should be ready to enter the existing game!

## Putting the New Player in the Game
It's time to update the game itself with the new player.

1. Go back to the Repl project tab
1. On the left, open the "Files" menu  
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/EPqBgcN.png)
1. In the "Files" area, open the "images" folder  
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/lLOjCWp.png)
1. Drag the **player.png** file into the "images" folder  
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/tOOkHNe.png)
1. In the popup that appears, click the "Replace" button
   - This will overwrite the existing **player.png** file

Run the program again, and at this point, the new player should appear!

## Next Steps
After the follow-along activity, there are some [challenges](AnimationChallenges.md) to complete. Feel free to get creative and do whatever you want to do with Piskel though!
