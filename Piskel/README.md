# Animation session
This session allows students to create some animations of their own. The workshop uses [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) as a tool for creating pixel art, and a [JavaScript Game](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer) where the art can be used. The game is a modified version of the game from [this tutorial](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/).

## Piskel Demo
Go through the guide on [this page](PiskelDemo.md) to demonstrate the use of Piskel. Show some of the tools and capabilities of the app, and allow the students to create some art of their own after introducing the concepts.

## Game Animation Follow-Along
Walk through the instructions on [this page](GameAnimation.md) to update some art for an existing platformer game. Students will fork the [existing game](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer) and play it. Then, they  will take the [existing player walk cycle](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/agxzfnBpc2tlbC1hcHByEwsSBlBpc2tlbBiAgOD48dSaCgw/edit) and modify it in Piskel. Then, they will put the updated player animation in the game.

## Challenges
Give the students some time to work on the [challenges](AnimationChallenges.md). They can work on animations in Piskel, replacing game art, updating game code, or anything else related to animation.
