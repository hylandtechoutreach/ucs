# Animation session
This session allows students to create some animations of their own. The workshop uses [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) as a tool for creating pixel art, and a [JavaScript Game](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer) where the art can be used. The game is a modified version of the game from [this tutorial](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/).

## Icebreaker
For an icebreaker this week, play a quick game of [Drawasaurus](../Icebreakers/DrawasaurusIcebreaker.md).

### Custom Words
When setting up the Drawasaurus room, copy and paste these custom words:

```
coding, hyland, westlake ohio, software, development, computer science, computer, website,
web browser, document, html element, angle brackets, opening tag, closing tag, html, body,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, paragraph, header, link, img, iframe, youtube, embed, attribute,

font-size, font-family, border, class, selector, property, value, declaration, ruleset,
curly brackets, colon, semi-colon
```

### Something Else
Since this is the last session of the academy, the students may do another icebreaker activity if desired.

## Piskel Demo
Go through the guide on [this page](PiskelDemo.md) to demonstrate the use of Piskel. Show some of the tools and capabilities of the app, and allow the students to create some art of their own after introducing the concepts.

## Game Animation Follow-Along
Walk through the instructions on [this page](GameAnimation.md) to update some art for an existing platformer game. Students will fork the [existing game](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer) and play it. Then, they  will take the [existing player walk cycle](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/agxzfnBpc2tlbC1hcHByEwsSBlBpc2tlbBiAgOD48dSaCgw/edit) and modify it in Piskel. Then, they will put the updated player animation in the game.

## Challenges
Give the students some time to work on the [challenges](AnimationChallenges.md). They can work on animations in Piskel, replacing game art, updating game code, or anything else related to animation.
