# Basic HTML Elements
For the first content lesson of the series, go over HTML elements. The purpose of this lesson is to show the students what they can create with some basic elements. Overall, this first lesson should be pretty straightforward. Introduce HTML, show the students some examples and have them get some hands-on experience writing HTML.

## Icebreaker
Add an icebreaker here.

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint Presentation](HelloHtml.pptx) introduces the idea of HTML and shows how some basic elements work.

## Typing Practice
Give students some time to practice typing, specifically HTML. The goal is for them to get used to typing HTML symbols (like `<`, `>`, `/`, `=`, and tag names) without having to worry about what any of it means. Use [typing.com](https://www.typing.com/student/lesson/12950/html-the-structure-of-a-webpage) to practice. Note that the interactive walkthrough goes over some HTML concepts that are not covered in this program; students should not worry about understanding this new concepts. Students should see if they can make it through all nine parts, but if they do not complete them within the allotted time, that is okay. The Replit Setup is more important.

## Replit Setup
Have students create accounts on Replit by following the [Replit Setup instructions](https://hylandtechclub.com/ReplitSetup).

## Kahoot
There is a [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/740e9179-5b3b-426c-a5ef-e770b2bd60c4) covering the content from the lecture.

## NitroType Races
With any remaining time, let the students compete in typing races [here](https://www.nitrotype.com/).
