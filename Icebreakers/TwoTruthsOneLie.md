# Two Truths and a Lie
A simple social deduction game designed to get students to share a bit about themselves.

## Materials
These materials are not fully necessary, but can be helpful:

- Pieces of paper (at least one for each student)
- Pens (at least one for each student)

## Instructions
There are many possible modifications, but here is one basic way to play.

1. Have each student come up with three statements about themselves; two true, and one false
    - If materials are available, have the students write down their statements
1. Select each student one-by-one, and have them read their three statements
1. After hearing the three statements, the other students should vote for which statement they think is the **lie**
    - They can hold up the number of the statement with their fingers, e.g., hold up one finger if they thought the first statement was false
1. The selected student can earn one point for every person they fool
1. The guessing students can earn two points for correctly spotting the lie
1. Once every student has been selected, tally up the point totals and see who wins!
