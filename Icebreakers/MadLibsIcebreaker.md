# Mad Libs Icebreaker
Play a quick game of online mad libs with the students.

## Stories
There is currently one story that is relevant to computer science: [Alan Turing](https://madlibs.hylandoutreach.repl.co/turing.html).

If another topic is desired, a new story can be created. A simple way to do this is currently in progress. For the story itself, one method is to copy the Wikipedia page for a concept or person, and then replace some of the words in it.

## Instructions
Follow these instructions for the icebreaker.

1. Visit the page for the story
1. Go around the room and have each student provide an answer for one of the words
    - Make sure that each student can answer for at least one of the words
