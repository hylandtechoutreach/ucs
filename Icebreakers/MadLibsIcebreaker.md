# Mad Libs Icebreaker
Play a quick game of online mad libs with the students.

## Stories
There are a few stories about relevant computer science topics:

- [Computers](https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/story-1998/) (14 words)
- [Websites](https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/story-2000/) (19 words)
- [Alan Turing](https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/story-2003/) (21 words)
- [CSS](https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/story-2004/) (18 words)

The one about Alan Turing is probably the best one. If another topic is desired, a [new story](https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/story/create/) can be created. One method is to copy the Wikipedia page for a concept or person, and then replace some of the words in it.
