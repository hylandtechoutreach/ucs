# Drawasaurus Icebreaker
Drawasaurus is basically online Pictionary. One student (the drawer) will be given a text prompt, and attempt to draw a picture of it. The other students (the guessers) will have to guess what the drawer is drawing! Guessers who provide correct guesses earn points based on how quickly they answer, and the drawer earns points for each correct guess as well.

## Custom Words
Drawasaurus allows the room creator to add custom words. This can be a helpful way to tie the icebreaker back to the material. Depending on when this activity is facilitated, the list of custom words may be different.
