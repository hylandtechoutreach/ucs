# Snowball Fight
This icebreaker is fairly simple.

## Materials
Some basic materials will be required for this activity:

- Pieces of paper (at least one for each student)
- Pens (at least one for each student)

## Instructions
Follow these steps to facilitate the activity:

1. Give each student a piece of paper and a pen
1. Have each student write down a question on their piece of paper
  - It should be a question you would ask if you want to get to know somebody
1. Have each student crumple up their paper into a ball
1. For one minute, have students participate in a "snowball fight" where they throw the paper balls at each other
1. After the minute, have each student pick up the nearest paper ball
1. Go around the room and have each student read their question and answer it
  - For a first-time icebreaker, students should also introduce themselves with their name and grade level
