# Drawphone Icebreaker
Drawphone is basically online [telestrations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46213/telestrations) - basically, [telephone](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Telephone-Game) with pictures. Each player draws a prompt, then those drawings get passed onto new players who have to guess what the prompt was (or just make up a new caption for the picture). This continues until the chain of alternating prompts and pictures reaches the (often ridiculous) end.
