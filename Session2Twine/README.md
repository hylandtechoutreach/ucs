## Lecture
The [PowerPoint](InteractiveStorytelling.pptx) is a brief introduction to interactive fiction. It does not dive into the specifics of Twine; that will happen in the follow-along.

## Kahoot
There is a [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/interactive-storytelling-virtual/87fec6d2-3de2-43ac-960a-51f63524c79d) covering the content from the lecture. This is mostly for fun.

## Follow-Along Activity
For the [follow-along activity](FollowAlong.md), get into Twine and start building a story with the students.

### Student-driven Stories
It will be beneficial to allow the students to drive the story-writing process. Take suggestions from them for the content of the story, the branches, the characters, etc. Make sure their suggestions are conducive to a story with at least one variable, and multiple branches reaching the same node.

An easy way to accomplish this is to make a "Day in the Life" story. Begin with the main character waking up. Have every branch eventually lead to the character going to bed at night. Throughout the day, choose to track some information that may change (e.g., the main character's **GPA**). This should allow room for creativity while covering all of the essential topics.

Note that the students can also create stories that do not align with the follow-along; any creativity of that nature should be encouraged.

## Individual Exercise
If there is any time remaining, allow the students to complete the [individual exercise](IndividualExercise.md). There is an open-ended option and a more structured option. The goal is for the students to enjoy working in Twine or writing a story. Encourage them to be creative and have fun with their stories. If a student says they are "done" writing, try to guide them to another chapter or another pathway their story could take.

## Sharing Stories
There is a link within the follow-along to a ShareBase folder where the students can upload their stories: https://app.sharebase.com/#/folder/1488801/share/3-cudZENqtVsCX7JgrjVtKItoCCO8

Toward the end of the session, encourage students to upload their stories. Download them and open them in a web browser to read through them as a group.
