# JavaScript
For this session, introduce JavaScript to the students. This will be fairly advanced, so many of the students may not fully grasp the concepts. The idea is for all of them to learn what JavaScript is, and see it in action while making a quiz about themselves - they do not need to understand everything.

## Code-Along Activity: About Me Quiz
Since there is a lot to cover in the [code-along](QuizCodeAlong.md), jump right into it at the beginning. Throughout the code-along, explain each new topic by reading the guide. It may take the entire session to walk through each of the parts, but try to make sure each student has a working knowledge of the code.

## Individual Exercise: Quiz Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](QuizIndividual.md) independently to make more updates to their quiz.
