# More CSS - Classes
For this session, introduce CSS classes to the students. They can use classes to style HTML elements more specifically.

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint Presentation](CssClassSelector.pptx) introduces CSS classes.

## Kahoot
Facilitate the [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/3b80ee62-4b67-49d6-b89d-1edd80a4db23) to gauge student understanding from the lecture.

## Code-Along Activity: Rainbow Poem
Walk through the [Rainbow Poem Code-Along](RainbowPoemCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should take an existing HTML website that uses some CSS classes, and update it to do more.

## Individual Exercise: Rainbow Poem Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](RainbowPoemIndividual.md) independently to make more updates to the Poem site. They should have a chance to make the site their own.

They can have the opportunity to complete challenges either during class or at home.
