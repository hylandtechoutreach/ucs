# Review Activities
During the final project work sessions, use these review activities to help students remember

## Board Race
Have the students split into two teams and race to answer questions at the board. Use the [BoardRace](BoardRace.pptx) PowerPoint Presentation for the questions. The team who finishes first with the correct answer wins a point. One instructor should present the PowerPoint, one should judge the answers, and one should keep track of the score. Students should rotate on each question so each student has the chance to answer at the board.

## Exterminators Worksheet
Each student has a chance to work individually on the worksheet. Print out copies of the [ExterminationQuest](ExterminationQuest.docx) Word document on two-sided sheets of paper, and hand them out to the students. They should look at the buggy code and try to write the fixed version underneath it.
