# Review Activities
During the final project work sessions, use these review activities to help students remember

## Board Race
Have the students split into two teams and race to answer questions at the board. Use the [BoardRace](BoardRace.pptx) PowerPoint Presentation for the questions. The team who finishes first with the correct answer wins a point. One instructor should present the PowerPoint, one should judge the answers, and one should keep track of the score. Students should rotate on each question so each student has the chance to answer at the board.
