# More HTML Elements Part 2
This continuation of the More HTML Lesson allows the students to practice the concepts a little more.

## Icebreaker
For this session, play a game of [Drawphone](../Icebreakers/DrawphoneIcebreaker.md).

Alternatively, break the students into groups and have them compete in [web design project](NewYearWebDesign.md).

## Multiple Pages Demonstration
Present [this demonstration](MultiplePagesDemo.md) to show the students how they can create multiple pages for their websites. Students should each create at least one additional page.

## Project Work
Students should take time this week to continue working on the projects they started at the beginning. They are welcome to take them in any direction they would like - but they should try to add multiple pages.

## Baamboozle Quiz
To close out the session, play through a [Baamboozle group quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/614321) that covers the material from the lesson.
