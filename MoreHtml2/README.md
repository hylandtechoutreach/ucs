# More HTML Elements Part 2
This continuation of the More HTML Lesson allows the students to practice the concepts a little more.

## Icebreaker
For this session, play a game of [Drawphone](../Icebreakers/DrawphoneIcebreaker.md).

Alternatively, break the students into groups and have them compete in [web design project](./WebDesignRequirements/).

## Multiple Pages Demonstration
Present [this demonstration](MultiplePagesDemo.md) to show the students how they can create multiple pages for their websites. Students should each create at least one additional page.

## Self-Paced Exercises: Restaurant Website Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](RestaurantSelfPacedExercises.md) to continue building their restaurant websites. Possibly have students work together on the self-paced work. There will be some guidance, but they can ultimately decide how they would like to update their restaurant websites.

## Baamboozle Quiz
To close out the session, play through a [Baamboozle group quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/614321) that covers the material from the lesson.
