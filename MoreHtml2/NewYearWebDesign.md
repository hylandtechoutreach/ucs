# Do Now: New Year, New Website!
So this is the new year. We currently have a very sad, depressing website - but it should be fun instead! Sadness is so 2023. Happiness is IN for 2024.

Work with a partner or a team to fix some issues with the site, and add some new stuff too. Whoever finishes first wins!

## Fixing Issues
There are so many issues with this website:

- It should say "Happy New Year" instead of "Sad New Year"
- There should be smiley faces instead of frowny faces
- It should say "I am going to celebrate" instead of "I am going to cry"
- The picture should be `gladdad.png` instead of `saddad.png`
- The link should go to a happy website instead of the Wikipedia page for sadness
- Under resolutions, it should say "I will smile every day"

## Adding More
Feel free to update your website with any new things you want. Here are some ideas:

- A new picture of something happy
- More positive resolutions
- 1000 happy emojis
- A HAPPY youtube video (not sad or scary or weird)
- A description of your wildest dreams for 2024

Feel free to get creative with this part!
