# Restaurant Website: Self-Paced Exercises
The website for Alfredo's Pizza Cafe (or your own restaurant) is pretty solid, but there are some changes you can make to take it to the next level. Follow the instructions below to add some new features to your website!

## Adding a New Location
Find the other locations for the restaurant, and add a new one! It could be any new location, such as "Cleveland, OH" or anywhere else. It should be a new `<p></p>` element under the existing ones.

## Adding a New Specialty Pizza
Next, add another specialty pizza where the specialty items are. It could be any new specialty pizza, such as "Margherita Pizza" or anything else. It should be a new `<p></p>` element under the existing ones.

## Adding a New Topping
Finally, add another topping to the toppings. It could be any topping you'd like, such as "Olives" or anything else. It should be a new `<p></p>` element under the existing ones.

## Size Options
For several types of food (including pizza), customers may want to decide what size portion they would like. For this restaurant, let's say we want two size options: Small and Large. Show these options beneath the menu on the webpage!

1. Create an `h3` saying "Size Options"
1. Add `p` elements for each size under the `h3`
    - One for "Large"
    - One for "Small"

## Crust Options
Many pizza restaurants have different options for crusts. This could also be applied for other types of restaurants - for example, tacos could have hard or soft shells, sushi could have white or brown rice, etc. Show these options beneath the menu as well! This should be similar to adding the different sizes.

## Link to Another Site
Update the link on the website so it goes somewhere else, or add a whole new link! It can go to any relevant website.
