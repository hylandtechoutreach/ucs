# More CSS Part 2
This lesson introduces a variety of things: [custom fonts](CustomFonts.md), [color gradients](ColorGradients.md), [text shadows](TextShadows.md), [transitions](Transitions.md), [transforms](Transforms.md), and [animations](Animations.md).

## Icebreaker: Drawphone
For this session, kick things off with a game of [Drawphone](../Icebreakers/DrawphoneIcebreaker.md).

## Instructor-Led: New Concepts Introduction
Briefly introduce some new concepts that the students can explore. Each concept has its own brief walkthrough (all listed on the [session page](StudentDesc.md)); students can pick and choose those concepts about which they would like to learn more.

[Here](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs/MoreCss2/Assets/Showcase.html) is a website that showcases each new tool. Take a couple minutes to show it to the students and demonstrate these possibilities.

## Self-Paced: Free Reign
The plan for this session is to give students free reign to create whatever they desire using the new tools. If a student shows no particular interest, they should go through each of the guides listed on the [session page](StudentDesc.md). If they complete that and still have no interest in learning more, they can work on the [interactive challenges](Challenges.md).

It may also be a good idea to introduce the [final project](../FinalProject/README.md) at this point.

### Instructor-Led: Walkthroughs
Students are welcome to go through any and all of the guides in a self-paced way. However, if enough students show an interest, feel free to walk through any of the guides in a code-along fashion. This may help students grasp the concepts a little better, and apply them to their sites.

## Formative Assessment: Blooket
At the end of the session, facilitate the [comprehensive review Blooket](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/633f2c2e7322dbfa304b717c). Note that a Blooket account is required.
