# Intro to Hyland
For the first week of material, introduce Hyland, and Computer Science. This should give students some context and prepare them for the course as a whole.

## Icebreaker Activity
Help students and instructors get to know each other with an icebreaker activity.

- Snowball Fight: Each student writes a question on a piece of paper, then crumples it up. Students have a "snowball fight" for one minute, then students pick up the crumpled balls and answer the questions while introducing themselves.

## Intro to Hyland Presentation
Present the [Intro to Hyland PowerPoint Presentation](HylandPresentation.pptx) to give students some background on Hyland. Ask students questions throughout. Try to sell Hyland (and software companies in general) as a great place to work.

## Classroom Expectations
Go over the [Classroom Expectations PowerPoint Presentation](ClassroomExpectations) to make sure students know how to behave in class.

## Intro to Computer Science
Show a video or two introducing the idea of computer science to the students. They may already be familiar with the topic, but if they are not, this can be a powerful way to connect it to their daily lives and get them excited. Many of these videos come from Code.org.

Videos:

After showing the video, ask students questions about what they watched.

## Questionnaire
Share the [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/aErAxixc21dv8mpK8) for the students to fill out. It will give us some insight into who they are before the course begins.
