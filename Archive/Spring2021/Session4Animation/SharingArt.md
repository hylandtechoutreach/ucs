- Use `Ctrl`+`v` or right click and select "Paste"

That URL should work anywhere, so feel free to send it to anyone.

## Sharing Piskel Art
There are a few ways to share art created in Piskel. The easiest way is to upload it as a **.gif** file. However, if you would like to continue working on your art, you may want to create a Piskel account to save it for future use.

### Uploading a GIF
