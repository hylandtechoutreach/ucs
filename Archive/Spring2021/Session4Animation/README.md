# Animation session
This session covers the history of animation in general, then touches on the origins of 2D game graphics and allows students to create some animations of their own. The workshop uses [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) as a tool for creating pixel art, and a [JavaScript Game](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer) where the art can be used. The game is a modified version of the game from [this tutorial](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/).

## Lecture: History of Animation / 2D Video Game Animation
There are slides in the [Animation History presentation](AnimationHistory.pptx) that introduce the roots of animation and 2D game graphics.

## Kahoot
A [quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/building-blocks-of-animation-quiz/53acd5a6-e3f2-4aca-972d-55f5f4bd8cc4) covering the content from the lecture.

## Piskel Demo
Go through the guide on [this page](PiskelDemo.md) to demonstrate the use of Piskel. Show some of the tools and capabilities of the app, and allow the students to create some art of their own after introducing the concepts.

## Game Animation Follow-Along
Walk through the instructions on [this page](GameAnimation.md) to update some art for an existing platformer game. Students will fork the [existing game](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Platformer) and play it. Then, they  will take the [existing player walk cycle](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/agxzfnBpc2tlbC1hcHByEwsSBlBpc2tlbBiAgOD48dSaCgw/edit) and modify it in Piskel. Then, they will put the updated player animation in the game.

## Challenges
Give the students some time to work on the [challenges](AnimationChallenges.md). They can work on animations in Piskel, replacing game art, updating game code, or anything else related to animation. 

## Sharing Art
Toward the end of the session, students can follow the instructions on [this page](SharingArt.md) to share their creations. These could be in Piskel or in Repl.
