# MakeCode Individual Exercises
Complete any of the following challenges that seem interesting. Start with the code from the [code-along activity](PlatformerCodeAlong.md), and then take a look at the ideas below.

Feel free to get creative and create something else too!

## Add a New Background Image
In the "Scene" category, there is a `set background image` block. Drag it into the `on start` block, and click the blank spot to open the Background Image Editor!

## Change the Jump Height
Find the code that makes the main character jump, and figure out how to jump higher!

## Add a Countdown
Adding a countdown will make it so the player loses after a certain amount of time. In the "Info" category, there is a `start countdown` block. Drag it into the `on start` block to add a countdown to the game. Update the length of the countdown so the game is still winnable!

## Add a Startup Melody
In the "Music" category, there is a `play melody` block. Drag it into the `on start` block to add a melody that plays before the game begins! Click the blank music section to create the melody, or choose from the gallery of existing melodies. Set the tempo too!

## Create a New Tilemap
Edit the tilemap to make a new challenge for the player! To make a longer level, update the horizontal size of the tilemap.
