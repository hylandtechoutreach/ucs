That's it! Now you have a Replit account and a Repl project. Be sure to remember the username, email, and password you used to sign up.

## Repl Overview
**Replit** is a website that allows developers to _write_ and _run_ code right from a web browser!

- **Code Editor** - This is where developers write code
- **Run Button** - Developers click this button to _execute_ the code
- **Run Area** - This is where the developer sees the results of the code

In the new Repl, click the "run" button to see the code execute. Note that nothing should happen at this point; the webpage is still empty.

### TIP - Boiler-plate Code
At the moment, there is a lot of "boiler-plate" code in the editor. Don't worry about that for now; you do not need to understand any of it yet!
