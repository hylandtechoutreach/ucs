# Basic HTML Elements - Part 2
For the second HTML lesson, practice using the basic elements and review the topics from the first lesson.

## Kahoot
Start with the same [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/details/740e9179-5b3b-426c-a5ef-e770b2bd60c4) from the previous lesson.

## Code-Along Activity: About Me Website
Walk through the [About Me Code-Along](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should build a simple website about themselves.

## Individual Exercise: About Me Website Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](AboutMeIndividual.md) independently to continue building their "About Me" website. They can theoretically add any appropriate content using the HTML elements covered by the lesson.

## Sharing Sites
