# Basic HTML Elements - Part 2
For the second HTML lesson, practice using the basic elements and review the topics from the first lesson.

## Blooket
Start with a [Blooket game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/63052a4dd30f31a865ea4da6) that reviews the material from the previous week. Note that a Blooket account is required to facilitate the game.

## Code-Along Activity: About Me Website
Walk through the [About Me Code-Along](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) activity. Students should build a simple website about themselves.

## Self-Paced Exercises: About Me Website Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](AboutMeSelfPaced.md) independently to continue building their "About Me" website. They can theoretically add any appropriate content using the HTML elements covered by the lesson.

## Sharing Sites
Students should have an opportunity to share their sites with the group at the end.
