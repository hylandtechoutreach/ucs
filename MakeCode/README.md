# MakeCode Arcade
For this session, introduce MakeCode Arcade to the students. This is meant to be a fun introduction to building games - each student should have the opportunity to put their own creativity into it.

## Code-Along Activity: Platformer Game
Since there is a lot to cover in the [code-along](PlatformerCodeAlong.md), jump right into it at the beginning. Throughout the code-along, there is no need to explain the topics too in-depth; it's more about getting through the material. It may take the entire session to walk through each of the parts; the goal for each student to have a working game by the end.

## Individual Exercise: Game Updates
Students should follow [these instructions](PlatformerIndividual.md) independently to make more updates to their game.
